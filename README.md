Project Description: Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Brain MRI using Deep Learning with Original and GAN-Generated MRI Data

Introduction:
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This project focuses on leveraging deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the detection of Alzheimer's disease using brain MRI images. In addition to utilizing an original dataset, this project incorporates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic MRI images, enhancing the diversity and size of the training dataset.

STEPS INVOLVED:
Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing:
- I collected a diverse and representative dataset of brain MRI images, including scans from individuals with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls and preprocessed the MRI data, which included normalization, resizing, and augmentation, to ensure consistency and enhance model generalization.

Original Dataset Training:
- I trained a CNN using the original MRI dataset for Alzheimer's disease detection. By doing so, the model learns to identify patterns and features associated with Alzheimer's pathology.
  
GAN Model for Data Augmentation:
- I implemented a GAN model to generate synthetic brain MRI images. The GAN is trained on the original dataset and learns to generate realistic-looking MRI images that mimic the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease and normal brain structures.

Combined Dataset Training:
- I Combined the original MRI dataset with the GAN-generated MRI data to create an augmented training set. This enlarged dataset helps improve the robustness and diversity of the CNN model.
  
CNN Model Fine-Tuning:
- This was followed by Fine-tuning the CNN using the combined dataset to adapt the model to the augmented data. This step enhances the model's ability to handle variations and intricacies in MRI images.
  
Model Evaluation:
- I Evaluated the trained CNN model on a separate test set of brain MRI images, measuring its performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.
- It achieved an accuracy of 96%, thus providing reliability of the model.
  
Interpretability and Visualization:
- I implemented techniques for interpreting and visualizing the CNN's decision-making process. This could include heatmaps to highlight regions of interest and provide insights into the features contributing to Alzheimer's detection.
  
Conclusion:
- This project aims to create a robust and reliable deep learning model for Alzheimer's disease detection using a combination of original and GAN-generated MRI data. By leveraging the strengths of both real and synthetic data, the model aspires to achieve higher accuracy and generalization, contributing to early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
